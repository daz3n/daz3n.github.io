<h1 id="parties">Parties</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Platintiff : Lucy</li>
  <li>Defendant: Zehmer</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="issue">Issue</h1>

<p>Does Zehmer have to hand over the farm if he thought the deal was a joke but acted as if it wasn’t?</p>

<h1 id="procedural-posture">Procedural Posture</h1>

<p>Appealing a decree by a lower court order that zehmer doesn’t have to turn the farm over to lucy. Lucy is seeking “specific performance” (wants the farm).</p>

<h1 id="facts-for-zehmer">Facts for Zehmer</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Lucy brought whiskey with him; Zehmer and Lucy were drinking. A waitress testified that the men were “drinking right much”</li>
  <li>Zehmer says he thought this was a joke; whispered to his wife that it was a joke</li>
  <li>The conversation sounded as if it was in jest</li>
  <li>Zehmer write out the contract on the back of a restaurant check - very informal</li>
  <li>Zehmer refused to take Lucy’s $5 to bind the bargain, saying “this is liquor talking, I don’t want ot sell the farm”</li>
  <li>Zehmer sent Lucy a letter saying he’d never agreed to sell</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="facts-for-lucy">Facts for Lucy</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Lucy had tried to buy the place before</li>
  <li>Zehmer actually put the contract in writing himself</li>
  <li>The contract states in clear terms the sale</li>
  <li>Zehmer re-wrote the contract, changing it from <em>I</em> to <em>We</em> When Lucy pointed out that Mrz Zehmer would need to sign it too</li>
  <li>Both Zehmers signed the contract</li>
  <li>The discussion about the contract was lengthy</li>
  <li>Lucy didn’t feel drunk and said Zehmer didn’t seem drunk</li>
  <li>Lucy immediately arranged financing and checked title</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="who-wins">Who Wins</h1>

<p>Lucy</p>

<h1 id="holding">Holding</h1>

<p>Zehmer acted like he wanted to sell, so it doesn’t matter what he was really thinking. Zehmer has to convey the farm to Lucy.</p>

<h1 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h1>

<p>There was an offer, acceptance, execution and delivery of the written contract. The law doesn’t require the mental assent of the parties - In other words, Zehmers thoughts are irrelevant if Lucy didn’t know what he was thinking. If you could get out of a contract by saying that you didn’t really mean it, then all contracts would be unenforceable.</p>
