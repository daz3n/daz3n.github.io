<p>Look for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facts of case</li>
</ul>

<p>who did what to who?
why are we here?
who is the person who sued?
whats the story?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Procedural Posture</li>
</ul>

<p>what court are we in?
what kind of judge is it and how much room do they have to maneuver?
trial court judges are usually looking at things fresh, and have lots of room to say what the facts are, etc
On the other hand, the appellate court isn’t always allowed to look at things anew, so if the case involves an issue of fact (was this witness credible, was this fact true or false, etc), usually the appellate court is only allowed to review that to see whether the trial courts decision was clearly erroneous (abused their discretion). However, if the issue is based on an issue in law, i.e interpretation in a statute, then usually the courts of appeals have more discretion.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Holding / Dicta</li>
</ul>

<p>The holding is exactly what the court said in order to resolve the dispute in front of it. In a common law system, this means that judges affect the interpretation of the law - successive judges must follow what the original judge says.</p>

<p>The extraneous prose that isn’t directly relevant to the resolution of the dispute is known as dicta. Dicta isn’t binding, whilst the holding is.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Issues of Precedent</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, historic methods of resolution are overturned if they no longer follow the current common law. Precedent can be overturned!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facts important to holding</li>
</ul>

<p>Facts that would result in a different holding if they were altered. What mattered?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Important text</li>
</ul>
