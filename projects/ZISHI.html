<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>ZISHI is an international financial education training business which as a subsidiary within the OSTC Group is uniquely placed to engage, train, and employ the next generation of trading talent.</p>

<p>My role is to create a <a href="/docs/ZISHI/Communication%20Plan/">marketing communication plan</a> and <a href="/docs/ZISHI/Promotion%20Strategy/">promotion strategy</a> for ZISHI to launch the trading challenge globally, with the unique pathway to achieving an officially recognised Level 2 qualification in Financial Trading.</p>

<h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>

<p>ZISHI seems to be a company that puts AI at the forefront of its’ development. It also seems to be oriented around the techniques layed out in Sun Tzu’s The Art of War - attempting to reach a deeper understanding of both yourself and your competition in order to gain the upper hand.</p>
