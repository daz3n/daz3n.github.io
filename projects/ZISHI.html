<h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>

<p>ZISHI seems to be a company that puts AI at the forefront of its’ development. It also seems to be oriented around the techniques layed out in Sun Tzu’s The Art of War - attempting to reach a deeper understanding of both yourself and your competition in order to gain the upper hand.</p>

<h3 id="key-messages">Key Messages</h3>

<p>Clear and concise messaging that communicates to the audience what ZISHI does and how they do it in simple, easily digestible language. The messaging should be derived from the company vision, which is ‘We imagine a future where anyone, anywhere can learn and trade with impact, changing lives for the better’, with supporting values of, ‘Resilience’, ‘Potential Unbound’, and ‘Collective Excellence’.</p>

<h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>

<h3 id="tactics">Tactics</h3>

<p>This is the blueprint for my communications plan. A tactical plan should include a linear strategy for reaching your goals. Strategies and ground level tactics support goals. Creating an outline that shows how tactics support strategies, and strategies support goals, is a best practice for strategic brand communications planning.</p>

<h3 id="marketing-media-and-campaign-types">Marketing Media and Campaign Types</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Television Adverts for broadcasts, Netflix (ew), youtube, and other video streaming services</li>
  <li>Product Placements in targetted movies/series/…</li>
  <li>Audio Adverts for Spotify, Apple Music and other music streaming services</li>
  <li>Billboards</li>
  <li>Emails</li>
  <li>Flyers</li>
</ul>

<p>Because ZISHI is targetting a fairly niche audience, unlike, for example, food services, to get the most out of advertising, I imagine that product placements will be fairly ineffective. Audio adverts will probably be fairly good, as will tv ads for video streaming services.</p>

<p>The reason Audio is good is because a lot of ZISHI’s target audience is guaranteed to be fairly athletic, and athletic people often listen to music while exercising, or watch a TV on the gym treadmill. Students of all sorts also play a lot of music, so this is probably one of the better avenues to channel advertising funds into.</p>
