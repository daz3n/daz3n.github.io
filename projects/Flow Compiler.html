		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Flow compiler was originally a solution designed solely for Particle Engine. The goal was to integrate a small scripting language directly into the engine to allow for custom behaviours to be implemented. However, it eventually evolved into a much more complex project, and has now been separated into its own solution.</p>

<h1 id="research-and-requirements">Research and Requirements</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Parse a C-like grammar</li>
  <li>Compile into bytecode</li>
  <li>Provide compile-time reflection information</li>
  <li>Allow linking to external libraries</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="ideation">Ideation</h1>

<p>The compiler is built as a recursive descent parser - they are one of the easiest compilers to implement, and conveniently allow a more accurate error reporting than other methods.</p>

<p>Since it isnâ€™t an IDE, there is no user interface - the compiler is a command line tool that simply converts source code to bytecode.</p>
