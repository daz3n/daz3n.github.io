				<h1 id="general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>

<p>The general data protection regulation is a regulation in the European Union law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area.</p>

<p>The GDPR applies to both ‘controllers’ and ‘processors’.</p>

<p>A controller determintes the purposes and means of processing personal data, and has obligations to ensure their contracts with processors comply with the GDPR.</p>

<p>A processor is responsible for processing personal data on behanf of a controller. They are required to maintain records of personal data and processing activities, and have legal liability if they are responsible for a breach.</p>

<h3 id="lawful-bases-for-processing">Lawful bases for processing</h3>

<h5 id="consent">Consent</h5>

<p>The individual must have given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose</p>

<h5 id="contract">Contract</h5>

  <li>
    <p>The right to rectification</p>

<h1 id="intellectual-property-ip">Intellectual Property (IP)</h1>

<p>Intellectual property is intangible property (knowledge) created by an individual or organisation.</p>

<p>Things like literary works, music, video, art, designs, inventions and trademarks are all examples of intellectual property.</p>

<p>Often, a large amount of time, effort and funding is involved in the development of IP, and the producer needs protection against other individuals or corporations profiting from their work without consent.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-two-main-types-of-protection">There are two main types of protection:</h2>

<h3 id="copyright">Copyright</h3>

<p>Comes into effect automatically - protects the expression or manifestation of an idea, but not the idea itself.</p>

<p>Copyright covers more traditional documents like books, music articles, and movies as well as things like software, databases, designs and other types of multimedia.</p>

<p>It normally extends beyond the author’s lifetime, but there are some exceptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sound recordings and broadcasts - 50 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Published editions (typographical arrangement) - 25 years</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Authors may licence others to produce copies, often in return for royalties</p>

<p>Copyright can be transferred</p>

<p>While software is automatically copyrighted, this doesn’t prevent others from writing theor own code to implement the same ideas.</p>

<h3 id="patent">Patent</h3>

<p>A more powerful means of protecting IP.</p>

<p>Protects the idea behind an invention, not just the manifestation of it</p>

<p>The ideas should be original and not obvious</p>

<p>Patents aren’t automatic - they need to be applied for</p>

<p>Patents are published, thus benefiting public knowledge</p>

<p>There are clear boundaries defining what can be patented. Software is not usually patentable, and artistic creations, mathematical models, plans, schemes or other purely mental processes also can’t be patented.</p>

<h1 id="licence-categories">Licence categories</h1>

<h2 id="commercial-perpetual-use">Commercial (Perpetual Use)</h2>

<p>One-off fee, and usually only one machine</p>

<h2 id="commercial-annual-fee">Commercial (Annual Fee)</h2>

<p>A subscription model, where an access key is provided and updated annually.</p>

<h2 id="shareware">Shareware</h2>

<p>Free trial period
Purchase required after to avoid infringing copyright</p>

<h2 id="freeware">Freeware</h2>

<p>Compiled vs open-source
still subject to terms and conditions, so copyright applies
may only be free for certain categories of use (e.g. non-profit, academic)</p>
