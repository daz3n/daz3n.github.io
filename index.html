					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
					I'm a UK based software engineer, skilled in multiple frameworks and tech stacks.
					</p>
					<p>
						I hold a passion for graphical programming, and have spent the last 4 years writing a game engine 
						to recreate the high fidelity graphics seen in triple A games today. It's difficult, but the journey
						has been worth it - I don't ever expect to commercialise the engine, but it's still one of the largest 
						projects I've ever attempted. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Although this website is supposed to be dedicated to the programming achievements of yours truly, I do actually have other hobbies.
						Having run competitively for a long time, I clearly have a taste for pain and suffering, and will do anything to sweat just that 
						little bit more. I've won absolutely no medals, but I still enjoy the sport, so I soldier on regardless. Apart from running, I've 
						earned qualifications in sailing, scuba diving, archery, kayaking, and skydiving. 
						Although I've never done it, I would love to try base jumping just once, especially while I have the time.
