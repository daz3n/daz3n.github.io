				<h1 id="brief">Brief</h1>

<p>ZISHI is an international financial education training business which as a subsidiary within the OSTC Group is uniquely placed to engage, train, and employ the next generation of trading talent.</p>

<p>My role is to create a marketing communication plan and promotion strategy for ZISHI to launch the trading challenge globally, with the unique pathway to achieving an officially recognised Level 2 qualification in Financial Trading.</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>With AI still on the rise in multiple areas, ZISHI is aiming to take advantage of its powers for its’ customers. Recently, Google’s LaMDA was claimed to be sentient by one of its’ AI engineers, capable of holding conversations about abstract topics like theory of self and emotion - proving the large steps that have been made in this field in recent years.</p>

<p>Equally, Google and OpenAI are both developing their own individual AI image creation programs - Google with Imagen and OpenAI with DALL-E. Each of these are extremely complex tools, capable of creating massively accurate images based off of textual inputs.</p>

<p>Another field in which AI is becoming increasingly common is chemistry. AI has been used to predict protein folding - something that would still be almost impossible for the worlds current supercomputers.</p>

<p>There are a massive array of applications for AI, expanding well past technology and into medicine, architecture, the arts, and a host of other categories.</p>

<h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>

<p>ZISHI seems to be a company that puts AI at the forefront of its’ development. It also seems to be oriented around the techniques layed out in Sun Tzu’s The Art of War - attempting to reach a deeper understanding of both yourself and your competition in order to gain the upper hand. It uses clinical aspects of psychological analysis to generate profiles for traders, allowing them to know and mutate their behaviours while trading.</p>
