If your tether is destroyed, your spirit will be separated from your body until you perish.</p>

<h3 id="soul-sacrifice">Soul Sacrifice</h3>

<p>Dissolve a part of your soul into a person or creature. While you both survive, you can feel their emotions and general state of wellbeing.
They also have access to an amount of your magic that’s proportional to how much of your soul you dissolved into them.
If they die, you will not regain your soul.
If you have no more of your original soul, you will die.
If you die, the blessing will slowly fade, as if it’s a plant that has stopped recieving nutrients.</p>

<h3 id="sight">Sight</h3>

<p>Drain the energy, health, magic, and soul of a creature in contact with you. You will not gain everything that the other creature loses. 
Instead, some of the resources are lost in the process, passing into the fourth dimension, where they dissapate slowly into the world.</p>
