<p>Walking through the streets that I once called home now feels - different. The eyes that follow my every move are unnerving me just as much as I unnerve them, staring at me like some exotic creature in a pen. I guess some part of me knew it would be this way. How can a creature of magic coexist with those that fear the very idea of magic itself? My foot catches on a slab of stone and unbalances me, sending me lurching forwards and out of my head.</p>

<p>My meanderings have taken me, once again, to my old haunt. The place lies abandoned now, a squat house near the edge of town, but my memories of it remain fond. Peeling off my rain soaked cloak, I take shelter underneath the entryway, a thick sheet of rain separating me from the outside world. Recently I’ve found solace in the isolation - there’ve been too many questioning glances recently, curious gazes, and fearful townsfolk.</p>

<p>Looking down at my hands, I twitch my fingers, muttering those familiar words as I call fire to my fingertips. The water starts to steam around me, lifting off of my clothes and forming trails into the otherwise cold night. One by one, the lights of the village turn off, the rain slows down and eventually stops, and the sounds of the night start to rise. They’re familiar to me. Slowly making my way inside, I light the candles, one by one. I don’t need them, but it’s habit, ingrained in me by years of repeating the pattern.</p>
