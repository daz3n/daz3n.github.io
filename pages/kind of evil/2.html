<p>Surprisingly, it spoke. With each syllable, the earth shuddered, as if it was repulsed by this creatures very existence. Still concealed by the shadows, its’ eyes glint against my torchlight, dark beacons that seem to hold the truth to every question in the world. “Come, Child”. The voice grew, an irristible urge that began to lead me toward the creature, even as I tried to resist. My feet quivered, grinding against the soft layer of sand that had collected in this particular cavern. Behind me, I can hear the rest of my team step forward, their eyes focussed intently on the creature before us.</p>

<p>The pressure grows, and with the last of my clouded thoughts, I push mana into the fire, desperately feeding the flame until it ignites even the hair on my arms, scorching my face and drying my eyes all at once. As the walls light up, I see the creature in its’ entirety for the first time. The first thing I see is a snarling face, sharp teeth gleaming like polished marble in the blood red recesses of its’ mouth. Dark eyes, piercingly focussed on each of us. A bare torso, lean and muscular, framed by the batlike wings that extend from its’ back, unfurling until their tips scrape against the edges of the cavern.</p>

<p>Snapped out of our reverie, we step back, feet scraping against the ground that suddenly doesn’t feel as firm as it should. It’s not enough. The creature snarls, pouncing on those closest to it in a flurry of claw and fang. Clearly visible in the torchlight, dark veins seeming to shift under its’ alabaster skin as it moves. Time slows, and I feel my blade rising from my sheath, countering the claw strike that was aimed at my chest. Fumbling to grab it properly, I duck, swinging the blade horizontally to score a deep wound along its’ ribcage. A dark ichor, almost tarlike, slowly seeps out of the wound and onto the ground.</p>
