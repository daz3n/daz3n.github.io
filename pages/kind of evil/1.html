			<h3 id="playing-with-fire"><strong>Playing with Fire</strong></h3>
<p>Something in me had always loved the idea of fire. Maybe it was the warmth, or the chaos that seemed to dance unaffected by the outside world. Right now, I’m holding onto the only one we have, and leading the way even deeper into the cave system below our city. Recent reports of missing animals have us worried that some sort of predator has made this its new home, so it’s my job to route them out. I can feel the full moon above us, churning the magic in my veins and bringing out the wilder side of me.</p>

<p>The musty air is still, hardly moving as we pass through it, and the only sound that breaks the soft falling of feet is the skittering of soft claws on rock. Every so often, my torch flares up as it makes contact with a spiderweb, illuminating the ceiling for a brief second before shrinking back down to a low burn. Except this time, a glint on the far side of the cave rouses the sleeping parts of my mind. Just high enough that it could be maybe a rock, embedded in the wall, or the eye of some other creature. Muttering to myself, I focus my mind on the flame, <em>willing</em> it to expand. My pulse quickens, and I can feel my vessel draining as the magic takes effect.</p>

<p>Peering into the darkness always feels unsettling, but once you see the eyes staring back at you, it graduates to fear. Pausing, I let my torch burn dimmer, watching the barely visible shadow in the cave. It still hasn’t made a sound, and my neck itches enough that I whisper out for my team. You can’t take your eyes off of things like this - if it turns out to be a faefolk, or a cherubim, I would be dead before I looked back. Finally hearing a response from my team, I step forward, each second stretching out into minutes as I wait for the creature to act.</p>
