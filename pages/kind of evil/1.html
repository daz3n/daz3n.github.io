			<h3 id="playing-with-fire"><strong>Playing with Fire</strong></h3>

<p>Something in me had always loved the idea of fire. Maybe it was the warmth, or the chaos that seemed to dance unaffected by the outside world. Right now, I’m holding onto the only one we have, and leading the way even deeper into the cave system below our city. Recent reports of missing animals have us worried that some sort of creature has made this its new home - maybe a starving bear, or pack of wolves, so it’s my job to route them out. Even now, underneath so many layers of stone, I can feel the full moon hanging above us, churning the magic in my veins and bringing out the wilder side of me.</p>

<p>As we move deeper into the caves, the musty air seems to cling to us, hardly moving as we pass through it, and the only sound that breaks the soft falling of feet is the skittering of soft claws on rock. Every so often, my torch flares up as it makes contact with a spiderweb, illuminating the ceiling for a brief second before shrinking back down to a low burn. These caves are well known around here, their endless depths having swallowed many an adventurer without a trace, and I can see why. The inspiration to explore the unexplored, and find the unexpected becomes stronger the deeper you reach. Almost as if there’s a magic lying over these caves.</p>

<p>Hagen steps up beside me, muttering an invocation as he grabs my shoulder. Although nothing changes for me, I can almost feel as his mind escapes his body, expanding throughout the caves to choose the most likely path - and avoid danger.</p>

<p><strong>He leads the way to the creature, avoiding dead ends, pitfalls, and other unnecessary dangers that caves might posess</strong></p>

<p>The torch flares up again, except this time, a glint on the far side of the cave rouses the sleeping parts of my mind. Just high enough that it could be maybe a rock, embedded in the wall, or the eye of some other creature. Muttering to myself, I focus my mind on the flame, <em>willing</em> it to expand. My pulse quickens, and I can feel my vessel draining as the magic takes effect.</p>

<p>Peering into the darkness always feels unsettling, but once you see the eyes staring back at you, it graduates to fear. Pausing, I let my torch burn dimmer, watching the barely visible shadow in the cave. It still hasn’t made a sound, and my neck itches enough that I whisper out for my team. You can’t take your eyes off of things like this - if it turns out to be a faefolk, or a cherubim, I would be dead before I looked back. Finally hearing a response from my team, I step forward, each second stretching out into minutes as I wait for the creature to act.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, it spoke. With each syllable, the earth shuddered, as if even the ground was repulsed by this creatures very existence. Still concealed by the shadows, its eyes glint against my torchlight, dark beacons that seem to hold the truth to every question in the world. “Come, Child”. The voice grew, an irristible urge that began to lead me toward the creature, even as I tried to resist. My feet quivered, grinding against the soft layer of sand that had collected in this particular cavern. Behind me, I can hear the rest of my team step forward, their eyes focussed intently on the creature before us.</p>

<p>The pressure grows, and with the last of my clouded thoughts, I <em>push</em> magic into the fire, desperately feeding the flame until it ignites even the hair on my arms, scorching my face and drying my eyes all at once. As the walls light up, I see the creature in its’ entirety for the first time. The first thing I see is a snarling face, sharp teeth gleaming like polished marble in the blood red recesses of its’ mouth. Dark eyes, piercingly focussed on each of us. A bare torso, lean and muscular, framed by the batlike wings that extend from its’ back, unfurling until their tips scrape against the edges of the cavern.</p>

<p>Snapped out of our reverie, we step back, feet scraping against the ground that suddenly doesn’t feel as firm as it should. It’s not enough. The creature snarls, pouncing on those closest to it in a flurry of claw and fang. Clearly visible in the torchlight, dark veins seeming to shift under its’ alabaster skin as it moves. Time slows, and I feel my blade rising from my sheath, countering the claw strike that was aimed at my chest. Fumbling to grab it properly, I duck, swinging the blade horizontally to score a deep wound along its’ ribcage. A dark ichor, almost tarlike, slowly seeps out of the wound and onto the ground.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone seems to be surprised that I actually wounded the creature.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The fight isn’t very long - we came prepared, and although the creature is deadly, it’s clearly already starving and weakened. We leave the body where it lies for now - if we need, someone can come pick it up in the morning to burn.</strong></p>

<p><strong>returning home, we’re met with anxious friends and family, eager to know what we found, and why we look so beaten up. Some jokes are made about not bringing back bear meat to eat.</strong></p>

<p><strong>we decide to send a message to the king, trying to find out what he can do about all these creatures that have started to infest our land. I decide to go, because I have magic and am most suited to the task.</strong></p>

<p><strong>when i arrive, the king refuses to help, saying we brought it upon ourselves by using dark magic. He then tries to kill me because the only magic allowed is what he chooses. When i manage to escape, he sends men to my village, aiming to hunt me and any other magic users down.</strong></p>

<p><strong>i run, escaping back home, where i tell them about what’s coming. We all decide to band together against a useless king, and tell other settlements near us what the king is doing, in the hope that they will join us.</strong></p>
