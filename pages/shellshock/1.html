		<h1> Shellshock</h1>
		<hr>
			<p>WAAAAAARRR!!!!!!! My ears bleed from the sound, spells and artillery shells exploding around me. In my hands is a plasma rifle, capable of accelerating the very air into blisteringly high temperatures. I aim, freeze, and squeeze the trigger. Then everything goes white. A scorching ray of incandescent plasma arcs from the barrel, hot enough that the muddy ground underneath it starts to steam. The gun whines, releasing the compressed gases inside it as the dynamo within keeps turning. I’ve been told by some of the older veterans that this weapon is similar to some of the ancient tokamak machines - a primitive technology by any standard, but one that led us to where we are today. The beam collides with an undefended creature and doesn’t stop, the plasma boring a hole directly through the sternum before passing out the other side. Ducking down, I pull off my eyepiece, made to protect our vision against both the blistering heat and blinding light that the rifles emit. Instantly, the sky is lit up by return fire, arcing over my head and impacting against the darksteel wall of the fortress, exploding into a frenzy of sparks and static bolts that seem to dance along the wall, before dissapating, or being absorbed.</p>

<p>Hungry for blood, the horde keeps nearing, like an unstoppable flood.</p>
