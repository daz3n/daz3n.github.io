<p>Honesty is the best policy, or so I’ve been told. Maybe that would be true, if I wasn’t a spy. Right now, I find myself talking to a diplomat who had previously arranged a meeting between me and his superior - Vlado Puta. With nuclear destruction creeping closer and closer to reality, it’s been my job for the past four years to collect and deliver intelligence to those at home.</p>
