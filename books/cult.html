		<p>As a child, I was always told to not question the book. It held the answers to every question, and was both my shield and sword against the wider world.</p>

<p>Our rituals might have seemed unusual to an outside spectator, and I had been warned that most wouldnâ€™t take kindly to being invited into our group, but it had never really been an issue. The wider implications always seemed to escape me, replaced by an unending zealous belief in the book.</p>
