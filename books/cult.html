		<p>As a child, I was always told to not question the book. It held the answers to every question, and was both my sword and shield against the wider world.</p>

<p>When my questions started to build is when the trouble seemed to start. Attempting to escape the followers that I was once a part of, I leave town, trying to build up a new reputation in a neighbouring city.</p>

<hr />
<p>A bitter story that follows the steps of Johann - a 23 year old herder who lives on the outskirts of <em>some rural town</em> - as he escapes, is found, and eventually abducted from his home by the people he once was a part of.</p>
