		<p>When I learned about magic, I never thought I would be the one to use it. It always felt like a trick - smoke and mirrors, as opposed to any real sort of miracle. But as I sit here, with flames dancing at my fingertips in the dead of night, I realise just how wrong I was.</p>

<p>As I enter deeper into the world of the arcane, I find out just how much magic means to a king, and what they will do if they fear it.</p>

<p>When the soldiers come searching for a magic-user in the outskirts of their territory, it sets in motion a series of events that could never have been predicted. As unrest with the crown boils over, I seem to be the final catalyst that triggers the start of a civil war.</p>

<p>Black magic has been feared for centuries, but with my informal training being classed as such, I’m hunted by the kings guard, forced to flee or defend my home. Pursued by royal spellcasters, my escape takes me to Ruidan - a city on the very outskirts of the territory, and so small that it isn’t even placed on maps. Here, I find more allies, and the issue of the crown outlawing wild magic becomes known to the fringe settlements at the annual gathering. Gathering together, we declare ourselves a new territory - free to all magic users, and prepare for subjugation…</p>
