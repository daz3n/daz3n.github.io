<p>Learning how to grow a successful business takes time. Networking, cultivating the image, and identifying opportunities are all crucial to success. Before starting a business of your own, there are a few things you should do first, to help estimate the potential success of your endeavour.</p>

<h1 id="business-and-market-analysis">Business and Market Analysis</h1>

<h3 id="build-an-idea">Build an Idea</h3>

<p>Despite what you might have heard, businesses aren’t made on first ideas. Before even registering a name, you should identify what services you will provide, who you will provide them to, and how you will provide the service. This can be anything - in fact, many successful businesses are things like car washes, food services, or cleaning services. These are also extremely good first businesses because of how low both their running cost and risk is. Restaurants can be difficult to profit from, are slightly riskier, and additional certification is required compared to the others, but they also provide a larger growth opportunity.</p>

<p>Likewise, a law firm, consultancy agency, or property development business can be started, but the complexity of starting, maintaining and potentially selling a non-trivial business can become more difficult. Many types of business require certifications to be maintained or purchased, and will hold you to a standard that must be maintained. Not looking into this early on can result in legal fees later down the road, stress, or potentially even time in jail.</p>

<h3 id="business-model">Business Model</h3>

<p>The model for your business is crucially important to the decisions you take, and is one of the core strategies that directs where growth is made, what actions are taken, and even the business image.</p>

<h4 id="business-to-business">Business to Business</h4>

<p>In a B2B business model, a business sells its product or service to another business. Sometimes the buyer is the end user, but often the buyer resells to the consumer.</p>

<p>B2B transactions generally have a longer sales cycle, but higher order value and more recurring purchases.</p>

<h4 id="business-to-consumer">Business to Consumer</h4>

<p>B2C businesses sell to their end-user. The B2C model is the most common business model, so there are many unique approaches under this umbrella.</p>

<p>Anything you buy in an online store as a consumer — think wardrobe, household supplies, entertainment — is done as part of a B2C transaction.</p>

<h4 id="consumer-to-business">Consumer to Business</h4>

<p>You are providing a platform for consumers to sell goods and services to a business.</p>

<h4 id="consumer-to-consumer">Consumer to Consumer</h4>

<p>A C2C business — also called an online marketplace — connects consumers to exchange goods and services and typically make their money by charging transaction or listing fees. Ebay and Fiverr are good examples of this.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>How does  you plan to make money with your business?</p>

<h3 id="analyse-the-target-market">Analyse the Target Market</h3>

<p>If you can’t point to anyone on this earth who you could convince to buy your service, you should find another idea. The most successful businesses are ones that other people will support. Likewise, if you have an audience, but they are already satisfied with their current solution, your service will need to be cheaper, better, and more convenient than the others, especially to start with. Having a store opening promotion can incentivise customers to buy services during the first few weeks, and hopefully keep them there when the promotion ends.</p>

<h3 id="analyse-the-competition">Analyse the Competition</h3>

<p>Sometimes an idea is truly unique, and there is either very little, or no competition. For the other 99% of the time, your idea isn’t totally original, and you’ve rather put your own spin on an already commonly provided service or product. In this case, there will be competition that won’t want their customers to leave. If you can’t provide higher convenience, lower cost, or better quality than the competition, your business will most likely fail. If you can provide one or two, then you probably have a fairly firm business idea. If you can provide all three, then your competition is going to get harder, and you will probably find that soon you will only be able to provide two.</p>

<h3 id="bite-the-bullet">Bite the Bullet</h3>

<p>For almost all businesses, it isn’t unusual to be operating at a defecit for between 2 to 5 years. Without funding, growth can stagnate, fall, and eventually die without having ever made you a penny. Almost all businesses will need to pay for a few things, and most will need at least a few more.</p>

<h4 id="insurance">Insurance</h4>

<h4 id="employee-wages">Employee Wages</h4>

<h4 id="advertising-and-marketing">Advertising and Marketing</h4>

<h4 id="website-hosting-and-maintenance">Website Hosting and Maintenance</h4>

<h4 id="building-space">Building Space</h4>

<p>For a lot of businesses, this one isn’t required, and should be avoided whenever possible. As well as the incredible price of renting a commercial building space, employee parking will need to be found or arranged, as well as the obvious cost of petrol. Having an actual physical presence also means that employee wages will be tied to location, so be careful of that too.</p>

<h3 id="advertise-your-services">Advertise your Services</h3>

<p>I’ve lost count of how many incredible projects have been built that never make it off the ground. The world is an incredible large place to exist in, and the chances are incredibly small that you will find people asking for services that you never advertise. Good adverts can revive a dying company.</p>

<p>SEO also falls under this category. Regardless of your business type, having a strong online presence is essential to succeed in the current day and age. Around 10% of people will read page 2 of their search results, and the higher up on page 1, the more clicks you’ll get. Being first returns between 20% - 30% of all clicks, so it’s important.</p>

<h2 id="catwoe">CATWOE</h2>
<p>CATWOE is a technique that provides a framework for defining and analysing business stakeholder perspectives, in order to get a much clearer understanding of the system requirements. CATWOE falls under the umbrella of soft systems methodologies, and is an essential element to providing a satisfying solution. The mnemonic stands for Customer, Actor, Transformation, Worldview, Owner, and Environment</p>

<h3 id="customer">Customer</h3>

<p>Who does the stakeholder believe their customers are? Each stakeholder might hold different views, and each should be captured here.</p>

<h3 id="actor">Actor</h3>

<p>These are all the stakeholders that are involved in carrying out the transformation. In this case, Actor means a different thing to use-case actors.</p>

<h3 id="transformation">Transformation</h3>

<p>The main business activity, and what allows a profit to be made.</p>

<h3 id="worldview">Worldview</h3>

<p>A summary of each stakeholders beliefs about the organisation or business sytem, why it exists and what it should be doing.</p>

<h3 id="owner">Owner</h3>

<p>Who owns the business system? Who holds the most power in this area of the business?</p>

<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>

<p>The constraints imposed on the business by their environment. Rules and regulations that they have to follow, etc.</p>

<h2 id="moscow">MoSCoW</h2>

<p>Yes, you read that right. The acronym is a method of prioritising requirements in order to complete the most essential ones first, and leave the less important ones for later. (The ‘O’s were added to make it an acronym but mean nothing).</p>

<h3 id="must-have">Must Have</h3>

<h3 id="should-have">Should Have</h3>

<h3 id="could-have">Could Have</h3>

<h3 id="will-not-have">Will not Have</h3>

<h3 id="awareness">Awareness</h3>

<p>Remaining aware of both local and global events can have a major impact in your business strategies. Many opportunities for growth will be presented on both stages, and by analysing them, you can reap the most rewards. There are many strategies for estimating the effects of strategic business decisions, but some of the most well known ones are PESTLE and SWOT. These techniques both aim to support the making of business decisions, although from different angles.</p>

<h2 id="pestle">PESTLE</h2>

<p>This is a quick technique to quickly estimate the effects of a strategic business decision, before its’ made.</p>

<h3 id="political">Political</h3>

<p>What is the current political climate? How will the desired action be interpreted against the backdrop of the global stage? Will they alienate a country, region, race or gender from buying your services?</p>

<h3 id="economic">Economic</h3>

<p>Can the business afford to take this action, and what are the financial risks if it fails? What are the odds of success, and what are the short and long term implications? Will it prevent a potential future opportunity from being taken, due to lack of funds? Sometimes a choice has to be made between a small immediate payoff, or a less certain, but larger future payoff.</p>
