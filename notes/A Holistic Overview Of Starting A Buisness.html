<p>Learning how to grow a successful business takes time. Networking, cultivating the image, and identifying opportunities are all crucial to success. Before starting a business of your own, there are a few things you should do first, to help estimate the potential success of your endeavour.</p>

<h3 id="build-an-idea">Build an Idea</h3>

<p>Despite what you might have heard, businesses aren’t made on first ideas. Before even registering a name, you should identify what services you will provide, who you will provide them to, and how you will provide the service. This can be anything - in fact, many successful businesses are things like car washes, food services, or cleaning services. These are also extremely good first businesses because of how low both their running cost and risk is. Restaurants can be difficult to profit from, are slightly riskier, and additional certification is required compared to the others, but they also provide a larger growth opportunity.</p>

<p>Likewise, a law firm, consultancy agency, or property development business can be started, but the complexity of starting, maintaining and potentially selling a non-trivial business can become more difficult. Many types of business require certifications to be maintained or purchased, and will hold you to a standard that must be maintained. Not looking into this early on can result in legal fees later down the road, stress, or potentially even time in jail.</p>

<h3 id="analyse-the-target-market">Analyse the Target Market</h3>

<p>If you can’t point to anyone on this earth who you could convince to buy your service, you should find another idea. The most successful businesses are ones that other people will support. Likewise, if you have an audience, but they are already satisfied with their current solution, your service will need to be cheaper, better, and more convenient than the others, especially to start with. Having a store opening promotion can incentivise customers to buy services during the first few weeks, and hopefully keep them there when the promotion ends.</p>

<h3 id="analyse-the-competition">Analyse the Competition</h3>

<p>Sometimes an idea is truly unique, and there is either very little, or no competition. For the other 99% of the time, your idea isn’t totally original, and you’ve rather put your own spin on an already commonly provided service or product. In this case, there will be competition that won’t want their customers to leave. If you can’t provide higher convenience, lower cost, or better quality than the competition, your business will most likely fail. If you can provide one or two, then you probably have a fairly firm business idea. If you can provide all three, then your competition is going to get harder, and you will probably find that soon you will only be able to provide two.</p>

<h3 id="bite-the-bullet">Bite the Bullet</h3>

<p>For almost all businesses, it isn’t unusual to be operating at a defecit for between 2 to 5 years. Without funding, growth can stagnate, fall, and eventually die without having ever made you a penny. Almost all businesses will need to pay for a few things, and most will need at least a few more.</p>

<h4 id="advertising-and-marketing">Advertising and Marketing</h4>

<h4 id="website-hosting-and-maintenance">Website Hosting and Maintenance</h4>

<h4 id="building-space">Building Space</h4>

<p>For a lot of businesses, this one isn’t required, and should be avoided whenever possible. As well as the incredible price of renting a commercial building space, employee parking will need to be found or arranged, as well as the obvious cost of petrol. Having an actual physical presence also means that employee wages will be tied to location, so be careful of that too.</p>

<h3 id="advertise-your-services">Advertise your Services</h3>

<p>I’ve lost count of how many incredible projects have been built that never make it off the ground. The world is an incredible large place to exist in, and the chances are incredibly small that you will find people asking for services that you never advertise. Good adverts can revive a dying company.</p>

<p>SEO also falls under this category. Regardless of your business type, having a strong online presence is essential to succeed in the current day and age. Around 10% of people will read page 2 of their search results, and the higher up on page 1, the more clicks you’ll get. Being first returns between 20% - 30% of all clicks, so it’s important.</p>

<h3 id="awareness">Awareness</h3>

<p>This is a quick technique to quickly estimate the effects of a strategic business decision, before its’ made.</p>

<h3 id="political">Political</h3>

<p>What is the current political climate? How will the desired action be interpreted against the backdrop of the global stage? Will they alienate a country, region, race or gender from buying our services?</p>

<h3 id="economic">Economic</h3>

<p>Can the business afford to take this action, and what are the financial risks if it fails? What are the odds of success, and what are the short and long term implications? Will it prevent a potential future opportunity from being taken, due to lack of funds? Sometimes a choice has to be made between a small immediate payoff, or a less certain, but larger future payoff.</p>
