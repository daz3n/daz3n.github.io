				<h1 id="the-pitch-deck">The Pitch Deck</h1>

<p>This is a set of slides, presented to potential investors in order to gain funding. They’re normally quite short, coming in at 10-15 slides long. During the pitch, a good pace would be just under 4 minutes per slide, spent on describing the contents and extrapolating.</p>

<p>Since there isn’t a lot of space to display information on the slides, brevity, clarity, and imagery will go far in conveying the ideas behind the business. Don’t try cram in as much information as you can onto the slides - instead, pin down key metrics that show your business growth and use those to lead onto more information during your presentation.</p>

<p>The aim of the pitch deck is to convince the investor that they will gain a significant profit from their investment within 5-7 years. The ideal business will have growth that looks like a hocky stick, and scalable for the investor to use their wealth to accelerate growth.</p>

<h1 id="structure-of-a-pitch">Structure of a Pitch</h1>

<h2 id="the-opening-slide">The Opening Slide</h2>

<p>The ideal pitch will play to the strengths of the business. The original pitch deck for Facebook opened extremely strongly, providing strong social proof in a concise, easily digestible quote.</p>

<p>Similairly, if your investor is knowledgeable about your business area, you could follow the example of Airbnb and display a summary of your business - why it’s appealing and why it succeeds. This single statement should be crafted to both raise an issue and describe how you solve it, elegantly affirming the inevitable success of your business.</p>

<h2 id="management">Management</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, a successful business isn’t made from a good idea, but through good management. The investor will be wanting to get a deeper understanding of the management team to assess which direction the business is headed. Displaying past accolades, current positions, skills and achievements can greatly boost the chances of attracting an investor.</p>

<h2 id="finances">Finances</h2>

<p>Equally, without an under-the-hood look at the financials of a business, it becomes much more difficult to gague the success purely on word alone. Providing revenue, total profit estimates, turnover, and other KPI’s will also boost the chances of gaining an investor.</p>
